# Include a signature in the URL
In addition to using Authorization Header, you can also include signature information in the URL in order to forward the URL to a third party to enable You can also include signature information in the URL in order to forward the URL to a third party to enable authorized access.
### Caution
- The use of a signature in the URL exposes authorized data to the Internet for an expired period of time, so please evaluate the risk of use in advance.
- US3 does not support the inclusion of a signature in both the URL and Header.
- Both PUT and GET requests support signatures in URLs.
- You can generate a pre-signed URL for a PUT operation that checks that the user has uploaded the correct content.  When the SDK pre-signs the request, it calculates the checksum of the request body and generates an MD5 checksum that is included in the pre-signed URL.  The user must upload the same content as the MD5 checksum generated by the SDK, otherwise the operation fails.  To verify the MD5, simply add the Content-MD5 header to the request.
### Signature Implementation
* Signature example
```https://*****.cn-bj.ufileos.com/us3-api. pdf? UCloudPublicKey=TOKEN_ 2368f919-0e7e-4e6c-affb-083fa53110e8&Signature=ExPEr% 2FBkI8AQZ2RP87UAgn%2BwkCk%3D&Expires=1656487334```
* Parameter Description
| Name | <br>Type<img width=200/> | <br/>If required<img width=200/> | Description |
| :------------------ | :----------------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- ------ |
| | **UCloudPublicKey** | String | Yes | Specifies the UCloudPublicKey used in the URL signature.
| **Expires** | number | Yes | A Unix timestamp (number of seconds since 01/01/1970 UTC) that identifies the timeout period for this URL.  If US3 receives a request for this URL later than the Expires parameter included in the signature, a request timeout error code is returned.  For example, if the current time is 1141889060 and the developer wishes to create a URL that automatically expires after 60 seconds, the Expires time can be set to 1141889120. | **Signature** **Signature Signature** **Signature
| **Signature** | String | Yes | The signature information.  The format is as follows:<br>``` StringToSign = HTTP-Verb + "\n" + Content-MD5 + "\n" + Content -Type + "\n" + Expires + "\n" + CanonicalizedUCloudHeaders + CanonicalizedResource ```<br>* The algorithm for signing in URLs for all US3 supported requests and various Header parameters is similar to the algorithm for including signatures in Header. < br>* When generating the signature string in the URL, it still wraps the other [signature]( https://docs.ucloud.cn/ufile/api/authorization?id= Header except that the date parameter is <br>* when using the URL signature US3 will verify that the request time is later than the expires time before verifying the signature| URL
